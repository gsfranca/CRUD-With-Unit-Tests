## :closed_book: About this project
Project created in 2023 as an activity to the Software Quality and Testing subject, a CRUD system tested with unit tests. The project was done with Java language, using the JUnit library to do tests, the NetBeans IDE and XAMPP were also used to code and run the program.
### Versions
* [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
* [XAMPP 8.0.13](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/8.0.13/)
* NetBeans (Any that supports the Java 11)

## ⚙️ How to test with NetBeans
You need to have the version of Java and XAMPP to execute that.
### • 1st Step: Import the database on XAMPP (Find more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ynKAAt1G4Y&ab_channel=AmitThinks))
### • 2nd Step: Open the project on NetBeans (Find more [here](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/step-by-step/importing/netbeans#:~:text=To%20start%2C%20in%20NetBeans%2C%20select%20File%20%E2%80%BA%20Open%20Project%E2%80%A6&text=Then%20select%20the%20folder%20containing,Project%20to%20complete%20the%20process.))
### • 3rd Step: Run the project
#### 3A: If you want to run the graphic interface of the CRUD, run "main" folder archives.
#### 3B: If you want to run the unit tests, run "ConexaoTest.java" file.
